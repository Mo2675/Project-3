### Notes
With this class, a full time internships and other obligations, I wasn't able to complete all of the Bonus parts for this one, but I'll get to it next time.
Some of the methods and libraries have deprecated or updated methods and conventions, but all the code within this assignment should be updated to the latest standards.
